# life360-rs

An attempt at interfacing with the Life 360 API in Rust. Not nearly feature complete, most basic functionality only.

## What works
* Logging in
* Getting the user's circles
* Getting (basically) all metadata about a given circle but also including the location, speed, battery charge etc. for all members.
